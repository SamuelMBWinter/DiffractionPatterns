# Diffraction Patterns

This script uses a specified function for the transmission of the electric field in he $x$, $y$ plane. The Fraunhoffer diffreaction pattern is the calcultated and plotted using matplotlib. Units on the sides of the graph are in cm, power is given in W m^(-2)

## Intensity in the Fraunhoffer limit

$$
I_{out} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{0} c | \~E_{in} (k_{x}, k_{y}) | ^{2}
